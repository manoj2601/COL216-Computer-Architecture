# MIPS-Simulation
Module Developed in C++ to understand the pipelining and hazard detection in MIPS Processor.  
  
The project is a combination of Assignment 7,8,9 and 10.  
Assignment 7 : Sample model  
Assignment 8 : Pipelined MIPS simulation without efficient hazard removing method  
Assignment 9 : Pipelined MIPS simulation with efficient hazard removing method  using forwarding and bypassing
