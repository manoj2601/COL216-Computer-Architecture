# MIPS-Processor
Developed an general purpose MIPS multi-cycle processor on FPGA using VHDL. A state machine was used to control the processor and Block RAM to store instructions as well as memory data. Demonstrated on FPGA which contains the different components ALU, Register File and Memory and executes a large subset of the MIPS instructions.
